          Today I learned to make this.<br>
          This is pretty awesome.<br>
          I also learned to implement a Deque with Python. It was interesting to change partners this week as I get to know people I have never worked with. I think it went pretty well and even though I'm leaving later than expected I did learn a ton and the work was equally divided.
          I'm also getting feedback on our server assignment and so far I'm pretty happy with that.
          Looking forward to use Jinja2 and templating a bit more so writing this learning journal won't be as tedious anymore.
          I'm also excited to pitch my idea to the class tomorrow and really hope I will be able to convey how important for people with apraxia and other disabilities it could be.
